below mathematical expression get executed 
```
console.log(40 + 8 + 23 - 7);
```

### Note 
1. variable name should be in camel case (example - firstNameOfPerson) or "_" within each words like first_name_of_person.

2. It cannot take reserved keywords as variables names like new or function keywords directly

3. it can take only $ or _ in variable name like _function or $function

4. "name" is keyword which is deprecated in javascript, so prefer not take it as variable name instead use firstName or fullName.

5. Always start first letter of variable name with lower case.

6. for constants like PI use all letter of variable name in upper case.

7. variable names should be descriptive.
